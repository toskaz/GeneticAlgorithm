The Grouping Challenge was a class-ending project in EPT classes, where we were tasked with implementing two classes: 
GeneticAlgorithm and Individual. Both classes had to integrate with the existing codebase, which meant ensuring compatibility with the pre-written functions, 
including the fitness evaluation function provided by the professor.
The first step was to analyze the existing code to understand its structure and how the new classes should interact with it. 
After that, the GeneticAlgorithm class was implemented to manage the evolutionary process. This included generating a random population, evaluating its quality, selecting the best individuals for crossover, and applying mutations to create new individuals. The process was repeated iteratively until the termination condition was met.
